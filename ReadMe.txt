Within this, you'll find two Python files: ELMO.py and classification.py. To execute any of these files, simply use the command python3 <file_name>. For instance, to run ELMO.py, you'd type python3 ELMO.py in your terminal.

## Files

- `ELMO.py`: Contains the implementation of the bidirectional LSTM model.
- `classification.py`: Includes code for classification tasks.
- `Report.pdf`: A report detailing the implementation and results.

To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the `.py` files.
2. Run the desired file using the command:
